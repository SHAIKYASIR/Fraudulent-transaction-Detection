# Fraudulent-transaction-Detection-
This project focuses on building a system to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify patterns in transaction data that indicate fraudulent activity and alert the system to prevent unauthorized access or actions.
Real-time Fraud Detection: Continuously monitors transaction data to detect fraud.
Machine Learning Models: Trained models to classify legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering for optimal model performance.
Model Evaluation: Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The dataset consists of transaction details, including attributes like:

Transaction ID
Account Number
Transaction Amount
Transaction Type (e.g., credit, debit)
Timestamp
Location
Merchant Information
